# Internal structure of the CBuild

`cbuild.h` file is an autogenerated file, created to make using this build system easier. This documentation will refer to CBuild as to collection of 10 files in `src/` directory of this repository. This are 9 main modes and 1 implementation file (`impl.c`):

 * `common.h` -> Common and misceleanous code and all includes.
 * `DynArray.h` -> Implementation of dynamic array in C.
 * `StringBuffer.h` -> String builder based on dynamic array implementation.
 * `StringView.h` -> Implementation of a string view.
 * `Log.h` -> Generick printf-style logger, implements log levels.
 * `Proc.h` -> Few utilites to work with child processes.
 * `Command.h` -> Command runner.
 * `FS.h` -> Filesystem and file APIs.
 * `Compile.h` -> Few utilites usefull when writing build scripts.

Dynamic array module is almost fully self-contained and only depends on `CBUILD_DA_INIT_CAPACITY` define that specify intial array size. String buffer depends only on dynamic array. String view is also almost fully self contained and depends on string buffer only to provide function to create string view over string buffer. Logger also does not depend on other things except for a macro `CBUILD_LOG_MIN_LEVEL`. Process controller does not depends on other cbuild parts at all except for `CBuildProc` typedef. Other modules are move interconnected.
