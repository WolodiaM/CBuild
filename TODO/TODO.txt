-  Better dependency parsing, generate full dependency tree:
    *  Normal fileparser, used before
    *? CC -MM  -MF parser, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5584435/how-to-print-dependencies-from-llvm-clang-equivalent-of-gcc-md
-  Change structure for cli parsing:
    *!  Add ability to preparse args before user init, and pass it to user init
    *! Or add second user init fucs after arg parsing but before loop
-? Add better logging
-  Add docs for emebeding recomp script and some hacks used in CBuild buildscript
-! Disable linking if no object files changed
- Check for change in registered defines/etc for thinking about recompilation, force recompilation of all files if toolchain-specified define changed.
- Threat rebuild as internal toolchain, apply hashing
-!!!!!! Use paths relative to CBuild.run
-? VSCode integration
